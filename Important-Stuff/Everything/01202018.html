<p> So today was a really good day. We went to Robotics and had a lot of fun. You even made a cute little pot
So that was cool. I had a lot of fun with you. It was kinda funny when Max got mad at you for throwing stuff
on the roof to get the clay down. Not much else happened today, except cuddles which are always 10/10 would cuddle
again :)
