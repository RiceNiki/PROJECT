<p> So today was the ASB Dance. It was awesome, we both had a lot of fun and it felt great to go out on like an actual date with you.
We danced a lot and it was very tiring but it felt rewarding to dance with you. It was great being able to dance with you and looking into your eyes while we were dancing to slow music.
You also ended up spilling Dippin Dots on me, but it was alright in the end.
