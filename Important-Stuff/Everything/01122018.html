<p> So today, I've started this little project. It's a website just for you, and it'll be online forever as long as I have
it on GitHub, I don't know how long it'll take to make this, but the plan is to get some songs done using a Vocaloid-like
program and those are gonna take the most time out of all of the things I'm doing. The other thing is the quiz, that one is just
fun but that's gonna be a little less difficult, just a lot of html files. I also have these blog thingys which are more
fun to do out of all of these things. That's all for now though, so see ya soon~
